###### ðŸ”Ž**CONTEXTUALIZATION**

Within the scope of Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) for timber purposes, the 100% forest inventory (IF100%), also known as the forest census, is a fundamental pre-exploratory activity. It is essential for identifying the productive potential of the forest, regulating forest production, and defining operational strategies for both exploratory and post-exploratory stages. Through IF100%, trees of economic interest (and potential value) with a pre-established minimum diameter are identified in the forest. These trees receive an identification plate, their locations are determined using GPS (Global Positioning System), and they are commonly identified by their vernacular names.

The identification of flora species is undoubtedly one of the main challenges of the forest census within the scope of SFM for timber purposes, as errors are not uncommon. These errors may originate in the field due to the confusion caused by shared characteristics between species, the use of different vernacular names to identify the same species, or even the use of the same vernacular name to identify different species. Furthermore, there is no obligation or concern to carry out botanical collections to confirm the species. This issue is compounded by serious errors that arise from converting vernacular names to scientific names, which are often based on pre-existing lists from environmental bodies.

ProcÃ³pio and Secco (2008) reported the grouping of species when studying the identification of trees called "Tauari" in managed areas in the central and eastern logging poles of the State of ParÃ¡. For example, in the central pole, *Couratari guianensis* grouped three species: *Couratari guianensis*, *C. oblongifolia*, and *C. stellata*. Lacerda and Nimmo (2010) also reported that 43.5% (132 species) of all species identified by botanical description were not included in the tree identification carried out in the IF-100%.

In this context, the "**Deep Bark Project â€“ Deep Learning to Recognize Tree Species in Timber Forest Management in the Brazilian Amazon**" emerged. The objective of this project was to develop a web application, based on artificial intelligence and computer vision, to recognize trees of commercially valuable species in forest censuses, within the scope of SFM for timber purposes. **The classifier available in this web application has an estimated accuracy of 95% and can be used to recognize 16 species of commercial timber value.**

This application can serve as an auxiliary tool for identifying trees in the SFM for logging purposes. It can be used by botanical identifiers, environmental agency technicians, and laypeople. It is expected to enhance accuracy in species identification, particularly for commonly misidentified species, thus minimizing the ecological and economic impacts of identification errors in IF100%. Ultimately, this technology has the potential to improve species identification across various regions of the Amazon.
